# training_2021

This repo is for Alex and Sam to learn from and on.

## Every week, another load of tasks that MUST be completed by 19:30 Thursday.

WEEK 1

- Add Bootstrap to the html page [SAM THURSDAY]

Structure the index html page with the following components:-

- collapsable nav bar [ so it works on both small (mobile sized) browsers *AND* desktop browsers ] 
[ALEX FRIDAY] {DONE SATURDAY MORNING, Sorry for the delay!}

- setup the main page with a bootstrap container div, inside that a row div, then a col-md-12 div [SAM SATURDAY]

- inside that col-md-12, a bootstrap jumbotron component [ALEX SUNDAY]

- inside the jumbotron, an h1 title that says "Aid BnB" [SAM MONDAY]

- add style rules for font-size, font-family, fade-in animation and color to the h1 title [ALEX TUESDAY]

- add a javascript console log to the script.js [SAM WEDS]

WEEK 2

- Add a custom font to the project. You can use Google Fonts (nice and easy) or another option if you can find one (try googling "Open Source Fonts" and then "How to use Google Fonts in CSS / HTML"). Then use that new font for the H1 in Jumbotron - [SAM FRI]

- Add a background image to the Jumbotron. For bonus points this should be centered and the centre of the image visible whatever the size of the browser window - [ALEX SAT]

- Using Bootstrap, add a responsive row of 3 squares, each one has a Description, a Price per night, a location (eg. Devon or London or Brighton). Border around the squares so we can see them, the text inside the squares to be neatly inside the squares, none of it going over/past the border. [SAM SUN]

- Put an image of a cottage, flat, house or dungeon... into each of the 3 squares. The image should remain centered and the centre of the image should always be visible no matter the size of the browser window [ALEX MON]

- Add an onclick attribute to each holiday-venue box/square. It should be handed a function that console logs out an `id`, a `town` and a `price` for the box/venue. Hint: this will require a new function in your script.js, the onclick attribute and for you to google how to pass arguments in a basic way to a function that is then itself handed to the click handler. So basically, click the name/town/price/box or whatever, and it should log out in the console the ID, Price, Town. [SAM TUE] 

- Add a footer (bootstrap or not, your choice). It should be responsive, contain some junk information about where AidBnB offices are, a london phone number, and a few nonsense blog titles or legal bits or something. [ALEX WED]

WEEK 3

- Add the same effect i have for my 12 column venue box (fade in and out and change font colour to white/black) - add this to the other proper 3 boxes [SAM]

- Try to get the parallax effect on the jumbotron image [ALEX]

- Make the 3 boxes fade in to colour and fade out to black n white [SAM]

- Add a shopping cart div/element on the left hand side of the page [SAM]

- When page becomes smaller (page < 600px ) then cart appears at the bottom of page [ALEX]

- Add a new element that
    has an image on the right
    has big promo text on the left saying something like "Bookings 4 Lyfe" or "Yolo Breaks"
    stacks responsively when the window is less than 600px [SAM]
