This repo is for Alex and Sam to learn from and on.

## Every week, another load of tasks that MUST be completed by 19:30 Thursday.

WEEK 1

- Add Bootstrap to the html page [SAM THURSDAY]

Structure the index html page with the following components:-

- collapsable nav bar [ so it works on both small (mobile sized) browsers *AND* desktop browsers ] [ALEX FRIDAY]

- setup the main page with a bootstrap container div, inside that a row div, then a col-md-12 div [SAM SATURDAY]

- inside that col-md-12, a bootstrap jumbotron component [ALEX SUNDAY]

- inside the jumbotron, an h1 title that says "Aid BnB" [SAM MONDAY]

- add style rules for font-size, font-family, fade-in animation and color to the h1 title [ALEX TUESDAY]

- add a javascript console log to the script.js [SAM WEDS]

If you get stuck:

Google things.

Ask each other.

Ask me.

## All has to be done by next Thursday though.

# WHEN EACH TASK IS DONE:

- `git status` [will tell you what has changed, if anything]

- `git add .` [will add everything that changed to 'stage', ready to commit] 

- `git commit -m "what i have changed this time"` [will commit the changes]

- `git push` [pushes the code to Github ready for next person to grab it]

# WHEN YOU NEED TO PULL DOWN THE OTHER PERSON'S CODE:

- `git pull` [will pull down all new code/changes made since the last time you pushed/pulled code]
